# Examples

This is an example folder including files of examples as new pipelines and use cases are added.

The current models are:


## Persistence
 The persistence pipeline is the first baseline that produces a forecast that is just the last value the model was given as an input.

 ## ARIMA


 ## LSTM
 Double Stacked LSTM Time Series Regressor similar to the one described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04431.pdf
